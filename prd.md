# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

**Product Name:** csr (Command-Line Search and Replace)

**Description:**  
The csr tool is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to mimic and extend the functionalities of the standard Windows search function. It allows users to search for files, directories, and content within files from any location on their Windows 10 Pro PC. The tool is built using Python and is intended to be a powerful, flexible, and efficient alternative to the standard Windows search, with the added benefit of being scriptable and automatable.

## Objectives

- Provide a CLI tool that replicates and extends the functionality of the standard Windows search.
- Allow users to execute searches from any directory in the command line.
- Offer a wide range of search options and filters to refine search results.
- Ensure the tool is easy to install and accessible system-wide.
- Provide a foundation for future enhancements and extensions.

## Scope

### Functional Requirements

1. **Search Functionality**
   - **File Name Search:** Search for files and directories by name, using wildcards and regular expressions.
   - **Content Search:** Search for text content within files, supporting regular expressions.
   - **File Type Search:** Search for files based on their file extensions or MIME types.
   - **Size Search:** Search for files based on their size (e.g., files larger than a specified size).
   - **Date Modified Search:** Search for files based on their last modified date.
   - **Location Search:** Search within a specific directory or drive, with an option to search recursively.

2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   - **Command Structure:** The tool should be invoked with the command `csr` followed by options and arguments.
   - **Options and Flags:**
     - `--name`: Search for files by name.
     - `--content`: Search for files containing specific text.
     - `--type`: Search for files by type (file extension).
     - `--size`: Search for files by size.
     - `--modified`: Search for files by last modified date.
     - `--path`: Specify the directory to search within.
     - `--recursive`: Search recursively within directories.
     - `--output`: Specify the output format (e.g., table, list, JSON).
     - `--help`: Display help information.
   - **Examples:**
     - `csr --name "*.py"`: Search for all Python files.
     - `csr --content "import os" --type "py"`: Search for Python files containing the text "import os".
     - `csr --size ">10MB" --path "C:\Users\Documents"`: Search for files larger than 10MB in the specified directory.

3. **Output Formatting**
   - **Table Format:** Display results in a tabular format with columns for file path, size, and last modified date.
   - **List Format:** Display results as a simple list of file paths.
   - **JSON Format:** Output results in JSON format for easy parsing by other tools.

4. **Error Handling**
   - **Invalid Arguments:** Provide clear error messages for invalid commands or options.
   - **File Not Found:** Handle cases where no files match the search criteria.
   - **Permission Errors:** Handle cases where the tool does not have permission to access certain files or directories.

5. **Installation and Accessibility**
   - **Installation:** The tool should be installable via `pip` and added to the system path for global accessibility.
   - **Uninstallation:** Provide a simple uninstall process using `pip uninstall`.
   - **System-Wide Access:** Ensure that the tool can be run from any command prompt without needing to navigate to the installation directory.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The tool should be optimized for performance, especially when searching large directories or drives.
- **User-Friendliness:** The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear and concise help documentation.
- **Compatibility:** The tool should be compatible with Windows 10 Pro and later versions.
- **Robustness:** The tool should handle edge cases gracefully, such as searching in networked drives or encrypted directories.

## Out of Scope

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The tool will be CLI-only.
- **Search in Archived Files:** Searching within compressed files (e.g., ZIP, RAR) is out of scope for the initial release.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The tool is designed for Windows 10 Pro and may not be compatible with other operating systems.

## Assumptions

- Users have basic knowledge of the Windows command line and Python.
- The tool will be used primarily by power users, developers, and system administrators.
- The Python environment is already set up on the user's machine.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher must be installed on the user's machine.
- The tool will use standard Python libraries such as `os`, `glob`, `argparse`, and `datetime`.

## Conclusion

The csr tool is designed to be a powerful, flexible, and efficient alternative to the standard Windows search function, with a focus on command-line usability and extensibility. By providing a wide range of search options and filters, along with a clear and intuitive CLI, the tool aims to become an essential tool for power users and developers on Windows 10 Pro. The potential for future upgrades and extensions makes csr a tool that can grow with the user's needs.
